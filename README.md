Task Eleven - Image Hover Effect
This repository contains two different implementations of an image hover effect. Both approaches cause an image to disappear when hovered over and reappear when the mouse leaves the area, but one is implemented using JavaScript and the other using CSS.

Files in this repository:
index.html - JavaScript-based solution
style.html - CSS-based solution
1. index.html (JavaScript)
This version uses JavaScript to control the hover behavior. When the mouse hovers over the image, the display property is set to none, hiding the image. Once the mouse leaves, the display property is set back to block, making the image reappear.

How to Run:
Open the index.html file in any web browser.
Hover over the image to make it disappear and move the mouse away to make it reappear.
